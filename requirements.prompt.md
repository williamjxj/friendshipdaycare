Develop a modern, attractive, and responsive daycare website using Tailwind CSS v4.1, React 19, and Next.js 15, designed to replace the existing website at http://www.friendshipdaycare.com/. The primary goal is to replicate the content and functionality of the original site while enhancing its visual appeal and user experience.

Incorporate the following features and improvements:

Content Integration: Populate the website with content from http://www.friendshipdaycare.com/ to ensure the new site accurately reflects the daycare's information and services. Enhance the content with attractive highlights, inspiring words, and compelling introductions, such as a homepage summary that captures the essence of the daycare (e.g., "Where Little Dreams Take Flight").

Image Gallery: Extract images from the gallery section of http://www.friendshipdaycare.com/gallery/ and implement a fancy, animated carousel for displaying these images. The carousel should be visually engaging and user-friendly.

Google Maps Integration: Embed a Google Map to display the daycare's location with the following address: Friendship Corner Daycare 2950 Dewdney Trunk Road Coquitlam, BC V3C 2J4 Canada

Video Player Feature: Integrate a video player to showcase daily updated content. This could include short animated Bible stories or daily Montessori-based lessons combined with Bible stories suitable for children. The video player should be easily accessible and provide a seamless viewing experience.

Additional Considerations: The website should be designed with a UI-friendly and responsive design, ensuring optimal viewing and functionality across various devices. Consider incorporating modern animations and interactive elements to enhance user engagement. The design should be suitable for the topic of childcare, creating a welcoming and engaging online presence. The website should also support multiple language options, including Chinese, French, Spanish, and Korean, to cater to a diverse audience. Provide multiple theme choices to allow for customization.
